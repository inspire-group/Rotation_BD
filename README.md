We develop a new physical-world backdoor threat model via rotation transformation, and demonstrate its effectiveness on image classification and object detection task. 


## Requirements
The code is tested with Python 3.8 and PyTorch 1.7.0. The code should be compatible with other versions of packages. `opencv-python`(cv2) is required

## Datasets

- [GTSRB](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/)
- [YouTube Faces](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/ytfaces/)
- [PASCAL](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/)

## Usage
- See  [bd_traffic/](bd_traffic/) to run experiments on traffic sign dataset (GTSRB). 
- See  [bd_face/](bd_face/) run experiments on face recognition dataset (YouTube Faces). 
- See  [bd_yolo/](bd_yolo/) run experiments on object detection dataset (PASCAL). 
- Since the main algorithm is easy to adapt to other dataset, we recommend writing the code within your own repo. 
- We also write the code `./other/rotate.py` that is compatible with [backdoor-toolbox](https://github.com/vtu81/backdoor-toolbox) to conduct more experiments. 


If anything is unclear, please open an issue or contact Tong Wu (tongwu@princeton.edu).
